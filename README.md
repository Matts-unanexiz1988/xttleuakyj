Okay, so I just sat through Rosario and WHOA, am I exhausted. Like, genuinely, I think my brain just ran a marathon and forgot where it left its sanity. First off, is it supposed to make you feel like you're floating in a foggy swamp cave while also hailing a cab in the middle of a massive thunderstorm? I swear, I need a nap just to process what I saw.

I walked into the theater thinking I was gonna enjoy a quiet evening. Ha, fooled myself right there. Two hours later, I'm staggering out with more questions than a five-year-old at a where do babies come from talk. Did they mean for the villain to act like my grumpy childhood neighbor who yelled at clouds? But dude, Rosario, the lead—she's like a fiery comet with a broken GPS. Like all over the place in the best way and the worst way. A wild mix between a graceful dancer and a caffeinated octopus. Who else could drag me from tears to laughter to, oh, I dunno, a mild headache?

The cinematography—oh boy, they really took the let's make them dizzy approach to art. It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 one of those home videos where Dad's still figuring out the camcorder. But hey, in an odd twist, it kinda works? Or it doesn’t. I can’t even tell anymore.

> At one point, the soundtrack had me believing elephants were crimefighters, which, yeah, doesn't exactly make sense but plays so well with the chaotic beauty. And can we talk about THE conversation about lentils? That randomness deserves an award. Only this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 could turn cooking legumes into existential exploration—or something like it. Maybe there's a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   magic that reveals all the answers? Ha, like I'd have time between chores and, y'know, more chores.

Should you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? If you enjoy feeling like you've just argued with a mirror, absolutely. Or maybe if you're fascinated with plotlines that don't even bother tying themselves in neat bows. Rosario is a ride, that's for sure. But whew, definitely a ride best taken on a day when your brain feels like untangling an emotional soap opera sprinkled with a psychedelic dream sequence. Just maybe get some good coffee beforehand.
